Kernel CI Frontend
==================

Data visualization tool for the kernel-ci-backend.

Installation & Run
==================

Requirements are defined in the requirements.txt file.

Once installed, to run the Flask application:

  cd app/
  python server.py

It will bind to localhost:5000

Configuration
=============

There is a default file with configuration parameters located at:

  app/dashboard/default_settings.py

To override those values, create a file similar to that one, and define
the following env variable that points to it:

  FLASK_SETTINGS

The important parameter to define, at this moment, is the BACKEND_URL, that
should point to the server:port running the backend REST API.

Deploying the Frontend
======================

In oder to fully configure the frontend, it is necessary to pass some
variables that are not defined here, since they contain private information
or that is not yet defined.

To fully deploy it, create a file with the following keys:

  backend_url:
  base_url:
  backend_token:
  secret_key:

The backend_url URL needs to have the trailing slash, the base_url does not.

The backend_token value does not matter at the moment, it just needs to be
defined. You can put whatever you want for now.

The secret_key value should be set to a random string. It is used internally
by Flask.

Optionally, you can override the following variable as well:

  hostname:

This one should be set to the FQDN of the server.

With the file created, to run the playbook:

  ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -e "@$full_path_to_the_file"

You need a recent version of ansible.

Adjust the ansible-playbook command to suite your needs, that is a default
command and might not work for you.
